# A-Frame Hexabody

![A diagram of the Hexabody character controller configuration from the video game BONEWORKS, found in the museum level.](res/img/hexabody.jpg)

This is my attempt to port the Hexabody character controller from Boneworks into WebXR using A-Frame and [PhysX](https://github.com/msub2/PhysX).

Right now the locomotion sphere and fender portions are working more or less as expected, but more work is required to get things like hands, crouching, and jumping working properly as well. This is being largely adapted from tutorials provided by Tomaso on YouTube: you can check out his channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8fssZ1EapXnS2NZGBoKJcA).
